                        Ukraine builds Darth Vader a statue, arrests Chewbacca,
                        and elects the Emperor

                    <p>
                        Ukraine is trying to elect Darth Vader to public office and the
                        campaign has not been going well. Although a statue to the greatest
                        knight of the Sith that ever existed has been erected to commemorate
                        all he did for the galaxy, the campaign hit a snag when Chewbacca
                        was arrested for illegally campaigning.

                        This isn’t some weird slash fiction written by a Star Wars
                        obsessed political science major, this is actually happening,
                        right now, in Ukraine. This is all the result of an internet-based
                        political party that has an actual message they choose to promote
                        through Star Wars levity brought to the political process.

                        The Internet Party of Ukraine was registered with the state in
                        April 2010, according to its Wikipedia page, and is based out of Odessa,
                        Ukraine the country’s fourth largest city. Far from a fringe movement,
                        the Internet Party is actually standing for “electronic government against
                        bureaucracy,” or updating the whole of Ukraine to reduce the amount of
                        government. The IP claims to be the first internet-based political
                        party and has had increasing success in the polls as they’ve tried
                        to bring attention to their cause by running eye-catching candidates.

                        The fact that Darth Vader is part of the city council election that
                        took place this weekend isn’t even news as far as the Internet Party
                        and Ukraine elections are concerned. Darth Vader ran as a mayoral
                        candidate for both Keiv and Odessa last year even though his application
                        for presidential candidacy was rejected (they couldn’t verify his identity).
                        He didn’t win, but the Internet Party became emboldened and put both
                        Vader and Emperor Palpatine up for this year’s round of elections.

                        Scientists collect dust from the ISS to figure out how gross it is
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Imagine you lived in a mid-sized apartment with four or five other
                        people, all of whom never left. Now imagine you were in there with
                        them for roughly six months and no one opened a window ever.
                        It’d get unpleasantly stale and smelly in there, and that’s
                        actually what astronauts on the International Space Station deal with.
                        It can be kind of gross, and scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion
                        Laboratory (JPL) have obtained samples to find out just how gross it is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Astronaut Scott Kelly described the smell of the ISS earlier this
                        year as that of antiseptic garbage, which sounds delightful.
                        JPL got its hands on one of the station’s 21 HEPA filters,
                        which had been used to filter the station’s smelly air for 40 months,
                        making it slightly less smelly. Researchers also got several
                        vacuum bags full of dust for analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The samples from the ISS were examined and compared to the clean
                        rooms on Earth that astronauts stay in prior to going up
                        to the station. These facilities are aimed at preventing
                        contamination of the ISS, but analysis of the station samples
                        showed that using it as a space apartment inevitably leads to
                        a buildup of bacteria. DNA analysis of the samples showed that
                        Actinobacteria skin bacteria were more prevalent on the ISS,
                        and the vacuum bags contained plenty of Staphylococcus bacteria,
                        which are also found on the skin. There were also some bacterial
                        strains not found in cleanrooms, but not in any dangerous amounts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JPL found that the vacuum samples from the ISS had almost 75
                        times more microbes than the HEPA filter, indicating the surfaces
                        in the ISS are much dirtier than the air. That said, they aren’t
                        much worse overall than the cleanrooms on Earth. The distinctive
                        odor of the ISS is due to the fact it never gets aired out.
                        Knowing more about how microorganisms are distributed on the
                        station could help keep astronauts safe on future long-term space missions.

                    <p>
                        The Moon Parka looks like a typical piece of cold weather gear
                        from the outdoor apparel retailer The North Face. However,
                        from a materials perspective, it’s a very important garment.
                        This is a prototype created in partnership with the Japanese
                        biomaterials company Spiber, and it’s made from synthetic spider silk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Researchers have been working with spider silk for years,
                        and you’ve probably heard all the reasons for that. Spider silk
                        in the right conformation can be stronger than steel,
                        but significantly more flexible and less dense. Spiber says it has
                        been working for more than a decade on the synthetic proteins
                        that make its version of spider silk (called Qmonos) possible.
                        It has gone through 10 design iterations and 656 gene synthesis
                        variations during that time.

                    <p>
                        The Moon Parka will be sold in Japan next year,
                        but there’s no word on a price. I’m betting it’s going
                        to be really expensive, though. In the meantime, the prototype
                        is touring around Japan in The North Face stores.
                        The parka is just the start, though. Spiber’s artificial silk
                        could have uses in other types of clothing as well as
                        the automotive and medical device industries.

                        Advancements in technology have eased my apprehension towards aging.
                        Seriously, autonomous cars may be a boon for all members of society,
                        but it will assure as a part of the population ages, their independence
                        stays intact. A group out of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial

                    <p>
                        Professor Dina Katabi, co-author on the study, says her team of researchers
                        have made headway in a wireless motion capture device that will help
                        “empower the elderly to live safely and independently.” They want to
                        make sure when someone falls in their home, a computer will know to
                        report it. However, the team is eager to explore its broader applications.
                        The researchers write that they “believe … RF-Capture marks an important
                        step towards motion capture that operates through occlusions and without
                        instrumenting the human body with any markers.” No power gloves, Wii-motes,
                        cameras, or motion-capture suits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This kind of tech could allow for a “new form of ubiquitous sensing which
                        can understand users’ activities, learn their habits, and monitor/react
                        to their needs,” the researcher write. “In addition, they can provide more
                        representative motion capture models in biomechanics, ergonomics, and
                        character animation.”

                    <p>
                        Move over, Fifth Element, this ultimate Element Cube has you beat!
                        This Borg-like structure contains over half of our world’s known
                        solid elements in one concise paper weight. It was a Kickstarter
                        that not only reached its mark, but surpassed funding with still
                        a couple of weeks to go. I guess people are really excited about a rock.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actually, some of these elements combined in the Element Cube
                        are minerals. All of them, however,  are metal. That’s how
                        it is able to be formed! The man behind the cube, Cillian McMinn,
                        founded a company that specialized in “powder metallurgy.”
                        They stripped all 62 metal-based elements down to their powder form,
                        applied heat, and pressed them at the same time to create a
                        variety of shapes and sizes. The 2 x 2 cube being the most
                        pleasing of these shapes, it seems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While it’s little more than a novelty gift, it is unique
                        in that it is the largest combined alloy in the world.
                        For collectors, it could take years and thousands of dollars
                        to build up a collection of this many elements.
                        So now you can take the easy way out and just get them all in one go!

                    <h1>This 3D-printed tooth can destroy most bacteria</h1>
                    <p>
                        Everyday of your life, you have to spend valuable minutes
                        brushing your teeth to keep the army of bacteria in
                        your mouth from winning the war. If only there was an
                        easier way, and before long there might be.
                        A team of researchers at the University of Groningen
                        in the Netherlands has created a 3D printed tooth that
                        kills the bacteria living in your mouth, thus preventing
                        tooth decay.
                    </p>
                    <img src="brighter-teeth.jpg">
                    <p>
                        The key to the bacteria-murdering tooth is a new type of
                        dental polymer that has been infused with quaternary
                        ammonium salts. These salts have antimicrobial properties
                        that can effectively clear bacteria from a sample in the lab.
                        They are positively charged, which causes disruptions in
                        the negatively charged membranes of bacteria.
                        Bacteria can’t survive with a ruptured cell membrane — it’s a bit
                        like popping a balloon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Presumably, you’d just have one antimicrobial resin tooth
                        in your head that could protect all your others from
                        plaque buildup. Since this is a physical disruption
                        of membrane and not a biochemical reaction (eg. antibiotics),
                        there shouldn’t be an issue with the development of
                        resistant organisms.
